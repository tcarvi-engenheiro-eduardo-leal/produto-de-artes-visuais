## Meshes

- Data Structures:
    - Blender uses two main data structures for meshes:
        - Mesh:
            - The main data structure associated with the ID_ME data-block type.
            - Focuses on performance with many elements.
        - BMesh:
            - Edit mode data structure that prioritizes implementation of small topology-changing operations.
- Meshes use data structures oriented around a struct of arrays paradigm.
- One idea behind that design is to decrease the amount of memory accessed in hot loops that generally only deal with a few data elements at a time.
- It also allows using generic algorithms that aren't necessarily only designed for mesh.
- For more background on the SoA paradigm in meshes, see the design task.
- Lazily Calculated Caches
    - In order to defer calculation of some runtime data until it's actually needed without duplicating work, there are a few lazily calculated caches stored on meshes.
    - Some examples are:
        - Bounds: (BKE_mesh_minmax) The min and max position of the mesh
        - Vertex Normals: (Mesh.vert_normals()) The normal of every vertex. The same as the surrounding face normals mixed together, weighted by the corner angle.
        - Face Normals: (Mesh.poly_normals()) The normal direction of each face according to its winding direction.
        - Loose Edges: (Mesh.loose_edges()) Whether each edge is loose, and the total number of loose edges.
        - When a mesh is changed, these caches need to be removed or tagged dirty. Generally this is possible with functions like BKE_mesh_tag_coords_changed.
        - Meshes support all generic attribute types.
- Elements of a Mesh Structure:
    - edges (linhas de limite)
    - faces
    - vertex
    - loops
- As a best practice, all manipulation of a mesh structure should be done using Euler Operators.
    - This would be beneficial because the Euler functions would benefit from more extensive testing, becoming very stable, and thus increasing the stability of the BMesh tools that rely on them.
- However, currently many of the BMesh operators edit mesh structure directly instead of using these Euler Operators.  It should be a post-merge goal to convert all BMesh operators to use Euler functions, potentially adding extra Euler functions if necessary.
- As part of the original design, BMesh would be capable of handling multiple boundaries for a single face, which would allow for holes in faces. This has become a non-goal of the first BMesh feature merge, as we have chosen instead to stabilize the existing BMesh feature set to prepare for the first BMesh merge.
